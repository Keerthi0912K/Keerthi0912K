- ⚡ Fun fact: Sure! Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's unique chemical composition and low moisture content create an environment that inhibits the growth of bacteria and microorganisms, allowing it to last indefinitely. So, that jar of honey in your pantry could potentially outlive you!
